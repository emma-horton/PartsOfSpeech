# Parts of Speech 
Implemented and compared the Viterbi algorithm with two related algorithms, Eager and Individually Most Probable Tags, to optimize part of speech tagging accuracy. 

## Purpose 
This project was developed for the “Language and Computation” module at the University of St Andrews as an individual assignment. The program, written in Python, utilizes data collected from UD Treebanks. The data was processed using the CoNLL-U package, and the model was implemented with the help of NLTK.

## Features 
* Implementation of three algorithms with varying complexity: Eager, Viterbi, and Individually Most Probable Tags.
* Training on corpora in three distinct languages: English, Swedish, and Korean.
* Evaluation of part-of-speech tagging accuracy for each language using unseen test sets.
